    :description: Instructions for setting up a Statistics Sensor

The ``statistics`` sensor platform quickly generates summary statistics from another sensorâ€™s measurements. See :ref:`statistics-description` for information about the available summary statistics.

The component calculates statistics over a sliding window or a resettable continuous window. See :ref:`window-types` for details about each possible type.

Each summary statistic sensor is optional, and the component only stores the measurement information necessary for the enabled sensors. This component uses external memory (PSram on an ESP32) if available.

You could also use :ref:`sensor-filters` to compute some of the available summary statistics over a sliding window. In contrast, this component allows you to generate multiple summary statistics from the same source sensor. Additionally, it calculates them more efficiently than sensors filters.

To use the component, first, provide the source sensor and then configure the window settings and the desired statistics.

.. _window-types:

Window Types
------------

There are two categories of windows. The first category is a sliding window. A sliding window has a pre-defined capacity of ``window_size`` measurements. The component inserts sensor measurements until it has inserted ``window_size`` total. Before this component inserts another sensor measurement, it removes the oldest measurement in the window.

The second category is a continuous window. This category of windows has a pre-defined capacity of ``window_size`` measurements or a pre-defined duration ``window_duration``. The component inserts sensor measurements until it inserts ``window_size`` total or the difference between the timestamps of the oldest and most recent sensor measurements exceeds ``window_duration``. Then, this component removes **all** of the sensor measurements in the window.

Instead of inserting individual measurements, the component can combine several sensor measurements into a chunk. When this chunk exceeds ``chunk_size`` sensor measurements or ``chunk_size`` duration, this component adds that chunk to the window. This approach saves memory for sliding windows, as memory does not hold every individual sensor measurement but only stores several sensor measurements combined. For continuous windows, this improves accuracy for significantly large windows.

If you want to collect statistics from a significant number of measurements (potentially unlimited), use a ``chunked_continuous`` type. It uses slightly more memory and is slower but is numerically accurate. A ``continuous`` type uses very little memory and is extremely fast. However, it can lose accuracy with significantly large windows.

  - Counts the number of sensor measurements in the window that are not ``NaN``.
  - By default, its ``state_class`` is ``total``.

- ``covariance`` sensor:

  - Gives the covariance of the sensor masurements in the window with respect to time.
  - If ``group_type`` is ``sample``, and ``average_type`` is ``simple``, then it uses Bessel's correction to give an unbiased estimator.

  - By default, its ``state_class`` is ``measurement``.
  - By default, it inherits ``accuracy_decimals``, ``entity_category``, and ``icon`` from the source sensor.
  - The ``unit_of_measurement`` is the source sensor's unit multiplied by the configured ``time_unit``. For example, if the source sensor is in ``Pa`` and ``time_unit`` is in seconds, the unit is ``Paâ‹…s``.
  
- ``duration`` sensor:

  - Gives the sum of the durations between each measurements' timestamps in the window.

``sensor.statistics.reset`` Action
----------------------------------

This :ref:`Action <config-action>` allows you to reset all the statistics by clearing all stored measurements in the window. 
For example, you could use a time-based automation to reset all the statistics sensors at midnight.
